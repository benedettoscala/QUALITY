# QUALITY: Quantifying the Quality, Fairness, and Performance of Large Language Model-Generated Data

## Introduction
This project, part of the **Software Engineering for AI** course, performs an empirical study on the quality of tabular data generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o. We recreated the **German Credit** dataset using different prompt engineering techniques: *0-Shot*, *1-Shot*, and *2-Shot*, to assess their usability across various dimensions.

## Research Questions
1. **Structural Metrics**: Evaluating Uniqueness, Readability, Consistency, and Completeness.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Examining F1-score and Accuracy of machine learning models trained on the generated data.
3. **Fairness Metrics**: Ensuring that the generated data does not perpetuate bias using Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD), Average Odds Difference (AOD), and Statistical Parity Difference (SPD).

## Results
- **Quality Metrics**: 1-Shot prompts produced the highest-quality datasets in terms of structural metrics but showed high data duplication.
- **Performance Metrics**: Models trained on 1-Shot generated datasets performed best, achieving an F1 score up to 0.968 and accuracy up to 0.956 on synthetic data without duplicates.
- **Fairness Metrics**: 0-Shot and 2-Shot techniques generally maintained better fairness metrics compared to the 1-Shot technique, with 1-Shot showing increased bias especially across demographic attributes like sex and age.

## Repository Structure
- `datasets/`: Original and generated datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data generation, analysis, and visualization.
- `documents/`: Contains the full report and a presentation PDF detailing methodology and results.

## Usage
The repository contains detailed instructions in the Jupyter notebooks which guide through the process of generating data, training models, and evaluating them across different metrics.
